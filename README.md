## Reason for Fork
- Fork of the original Poker bot to add support for a local wallet on the host machine.

## Poker Bot

A Clojure implementation of a poker game ([Texas Hold 'em](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em)) and a corresponding Discord bot to play poker in chat.

This is (roughly) how the logic part is used:

```clojure
(require '[poker.logic.game :as poker]
         '[poker.logic.core :as cards])

(def player-budgets {"Alice" 100 "Bob" 85})
(def game (poker/start-game 10 (keys player-budgets) (shuffle cards/deck) player-budgets))

; Available functions
(poker/possible-moves game)
(poker/call game)
(poker/raise game 20)
(poker/fold game)
(poker/all-in game)
```

## Bot

[![Discord Bots](https://top.gg/api/widget/461791942779338762.svg)](https://top.gg/bot/461791942779338762)

Here are a few impressions of what it looks like:

The bot is public, you can invite it [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=461791942779338762&permissions=329792&scope=bot).

It is currently not guaranteed to be online 24/7 since some things may still change, but it should be online 99% of the time now.

## Running

You are also free to host it yourself (either manually or using Docker):

1. Get [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) (not needed for Docker)
2. Clone this repo
3. Put a `cofig.clj` file in the repo that looks like this:
   
   ```clj
   {:token           "TOKEN"
   :default-wait-time       25000   ; The default number of milliseconds to wait for players when starting a game
   :default-buy-in  1000    ; The default buy-in if none is specified when running "holdem!"
   :default-timeout         180000} ; The default number of milliseconds after which the current player, if they have not made a move, will fold automatically
   ```
4. Run `lein run` or `docker-compose up`

Note that your bot needs to be on the [playing cards emoji server](https://discord.gg/sJB2xjK) for it to work out of the box. I am not the owner of that server, so I can't help with adding your bot there. Please be mindful of the server owner and don't annoy them.\
You can also use your own custom emojis. For that, you'll have to modify the emoji ids in `poker.discord.display`.
